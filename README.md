# About This Project

ðŸš€ Hey there, fellow coders! In this immersive journey, I am delving deep into the dynamic fusion of Cucumber and Ruby. Imagine a space where tests not only flex the muscles of my code but also dance to the beats of readability and collaboration, all under the tutelage of an online course.

## Tech Highlights
- Cucumber: A powerful tool for behavior-driven development (BDD) that aids in writing human-readable tests.
- Ruby: The dynamic, object-oriented programming language that adds elegance to the test automation process.
- Capybara: A web-based test automation tool that simulates how a user interacts with a website.
- RSpec: A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Ruby that enhances the clarity of your tests.
- Selenium WebDriver: Empowering browser automation for testing web applications.

## What to Expect

I am meticulously crafting test cases while simultaneously absorbing knowledge and experiences from an online course. Expect a blend of insights and code snippets as I navigate the intricacies of testing in the Cucumber-Ruby universe.
